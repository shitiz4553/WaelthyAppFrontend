Instructions for DATA JS :
- Object name clarifies itself with the data set linked.
- If you change any key of the data, please make sure you rename it in the front end as well.
- Objects can be grouped depending upon your requirement.

-Components 
The components that are being used are renamed under the same screen name where they are present.
Thus making it easier for you to find the components being used.

Latest methods of functional components are being used. We are not using any class components.

-Route
-Use index.js inside route to control the navigation of the screens

 Where necessary, comments have been added.
